#Scatterplot
```{r data}
install.packages("ISLR")
library(ISLR)
attach(Carseats)
head(Carseats)
```

```{r plot}
#Creating a basic scatterplot
plot(Income, Sales, col = c(Urban), pch = 20, main = "Sales of Child Car Seats", xlab = "Income (000's of dollars)", ylab = "Unit Sales (in 000's)")
#Adding a legend
legend("topright", cex = 0.6, fill = c("red", "black"), legend = c("yes", "no"))
```

`col` used to assign a color to the data points and in this specific case a qualitative data colum `Urban` is used to color the points.

`pch` defines the point symbol - see `?point` for more info.

`cex` character expansion factor.
